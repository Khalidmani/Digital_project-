        Approach
    Learn about the guiding principles, strategies, and techniques used to build and maintain Bootstrap so you can more easily customize and extend it yourself.
    
   
    Components should be responsive and mobile-first
    Components should be built with a base class and extended via modifier classes
    Component states should obey a common z-index scale
    Whenever possible, prefer a HTML and CSS implementation over JavaScript
    Whenever possible, use utilities over custom styles
    Whenever possible, avoid enforcing strict HTML requirements (children selectors)
    Responsive
    Bootstrap’s responsive styles are built to be responsive, an approach that’s often referred to as mobile-first. We use this term in our docs and largely agree with it, but at times it can be too broad. While not every component must be entirely responsive in Bootstrap, this responsive approach is about reducing CSS overrides by pushing you to add styles as the viewport becomes larger.
    
    Across Bootstrap, you’ll see this most clearly in our media queries. In most cases, we use min-width queries that begin to apply at a specific breakpoint and carry up through the higher breakpoints. For example, a .d-none applies from min-width: 0 to infinity. On the other hand, a .d-md-none applies from the medium breakpoint and up.
    
    At times we’ll use max-width when a component’s inherent complexity requires it. At times, these overrides are functionally and mentally clearer to implement and support than rewriting core functionality from our components. We strive to limit this approach, but will use it from time to time.
    
    Classes
    Aside from our Reboot, a cross-browser normalization stylesheet, all our styles aim to use classes as selectors. This means steering clear of type selectors (e.g., input[type="text"]) and extraneous parent classes (e.g., .parent .child) that make styles too specific to easily override.
    
    As such, components should be built with a base class that houses common, not-to-be overridden property-value pairs. For example, .btn and .btn-primary. We use .btn for all the common styles like display, padding, and border-width. We then use modifiers like .btn-primary to add the color, background-color, border-color, etc.
    
    Modifier classes should only be used when there are multiple properties or values to be changed across multiple variants. Modifiers are not always necessary, so be sure you’re actually saving lines of code and preventing unnecessary overrides when creating them. Good examples of modifiers are our theme color classes and size variants.
    
    z-index scales
    There are two z-index scales in Bootstrap—elements within a component and overlay components.
    
    Component elements
    Some components in Bootstrap are built with overlapping elements to prevent double borders without modifying the border property. For example, button groups, input groups, and pagination.
    These components share a standard z-index scale of 0 through 3.
    0 is default (initial), 1 is :hover, 2 is :active/.active, and 3 is :focus.
    This approach matches our expectations of highest user priority. If an element is focused, it’s in view and at the user’s attention. Active elements are second highest because they indicate state. Hover is third highest because it indicates user intent, but nearly anything can be hovered.
    Overlay components
    Bootstrap includes several components that function as an overlay of some kind. This includes, in order of highest z-index, dropdowns, fixed and sticky navbars, modals, tooltips, and popovers. These components have their own z-index scale that begins at 1000. This starting number was chosen arbitrarily and serves as a small buffer between our styles and your project’s custom styles.
    
    Each overlay component increases its z-index value slightly in such a way that common UI principles allow user focused or hovered elements to remain in view at all times. For example, a modal is document blocking (e.g., you cannot take any other action save for the modal’s action), so we put that above our navbars.
